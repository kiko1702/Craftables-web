        <p class="aboutusp">
            CraftAbles is a business that handcrafts things and sell them. It was <br /> owned by Selim Khaled and Mark Samer. CraftAbles was <br />founded by Mark Samer and Freddy Magdy.
            <br /><br />
            It all started when Mark and Freddy were together in "Sahel" and decided <br /> to look through old handcrafted goods. They found beads and strings <br /> and decided to make a ring (CraftAbles ring).<br />
            It looked so good that they wanted to sell a few of it on the beach.<br />
            Unfortunately they didn't have time to make enough rings to sell.<br />
            Then when they went back to their homes, Mark showed his sister the <br />ring he handcrafted. Then Mark got an idea to start a business that sells<br /> everything that they can handcraft. <br />
            He told Selim later that day in his training and he liked the idea so much. <br />
            <br />
            They started giving each other ideas, working on products and the <br />website.

            Then Selim wanted to quit, because he thought he didn't have enough <br />creatvity to run such a business. <br />
            <br />
            Then Mark replaced Selim with Freddy Magdy. Who was been a huge <br /> help. He made bracelets and suggested lots of ideas. <br />
            Freddy also owns 50% of CraftAbles (Mark owns the other 50%) runs the <br /> TikTok page, tests the website and makes these beautiful crochets you <br /> see everywhere on our website.
